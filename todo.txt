Creating a Hastebin clone involves building a simple, user-friendly interface for pasting and sharing text snippets. Here's a breakdown of the core components you might need for a basic version of such an application:

1. **App Component ([`App.tsx`](command:_github.copilot.openRelativePath?%5B%7B%22scheme%22%3A%22file%22%2C%22authority%22%3A%22%22%2C%22path%22%3A%22%2Fhome%2Fkali%2FDocuments%2Ffullstack-projects%2Fpastebin%2Fpastebin%2Fsrc%2FApp.tsx%22%2C%22query%22%3A%22%22%2C%22fragment%22%3A%22%22%7D%5D "/home/kali/Documents/fullstack-projects/pastebin/pastebin/src/App.tsx")):**
   - The main component that wraps the entire application.

2. **Header Component:**
   - Displays the application name and possibly navigation links or buttons for creating a new paste or viewing recent ones.

3. **Editor Component:**
   - A text input area where users can paste or type their text. This could be a simple `<textarea>` or an integrated code editor like CodeMirror or Monaco Editor for syntax highlighting.

4. **SubmitButton Component:**
   - A button for submitting the text to be saved. Clicking this button would trigger the API call to save the text and generate a unique URL.

5. **PasteDisplay Component:**
   - Displays the pasted text. This component is used for viewing a paste. It could also include syntax highlighting if you're using a library for that.

6. **Footer Component:**
   - A simple footer for the application, possibly including the application version, a link to the source code, or other relevant information.

7. **NotFound Component:**
   - A component to display when a user navigates to a URL for a paste that doesn't exist.

8. **Loading Component:**
   - Displays a loading state while waiting for API responses, enhancing the user experience.

9. **Error Component:**
   - Shows error messages, for example, when the application fails to load a paste or save a new one.

10. **API Utility:**
    - While not a component, having a utility module for interacting with your backend API (to save and retrieve pastes) is essential. This isn't a visual component but a service used by components.

For a more advanced clone, you might consider additional features and components, such as:

- **Syntax Highlighting:** Integrate a library for syntax highlighting within the Editor and PasteDisplay components.
- **User Authentication:** Components for user login, registration, and user profile management if you want to associate pastes with user accounts.
- **Paste Management:** Components for listing, viewing, and deleting user-specific pastes if you include user accounts.
- **Settings:** A settings page or modal allowing users to customize their experience, requiring a Settings component.

This structure provides a solid foundation for a Hastebin clone, with room to expand features and components as needed.
